Translation
===

#### Demo Internationalization (I18N)
This is the right place to see if you want to support I18N in your project.

It extends the angular cookbook on I18N of Angular Docs.

## How to use

Clone this github repo and run the following commands:

- npm install
- npm start

To create a translation source file called "messages.xlf" type `npm run i18n`. 

In the locale folder are saved the translation files for each target language supported.
Their filename extensions match a language-culture code from the following [codeset](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee825488(v=cs.20).aspx).
